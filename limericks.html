<h3>The Story of Mia</h3>
<p>
There once was a bunny with feet
<br>The bunny had feet made of meat
<br>She put on her belt
<br>Twas crafted with felt
<br>Then chopped up the buffalo beet.
<br>
<br>The bunny then met up with snoc
<br>The snoc had a weapon of rock

<br>Then filled it with lead
<br>And used all the fur to make sock.
<br>
<br>The snoc used her sock made of fur
<br>She gifts it to kot, who then purrs
<br>"This sock is so great!"

<h3>On rice</h3>
<p>
The twenty-six goblins of rice
<br>Were actually quite rather nice
<br>They gave rice to men
<br>Gave each of them ten
<br>In return the men gave them some lice
<br>
<br>However the rice goblins were
<br>No match for the french fry wizard
<br>He swallowed them all
<br>And from the sky falls
<br>A french fry who's name was called Sir.
<br>
<br>The sir was a yump and that sucks
<br>So out came a penguin named Tux
<br>He took out his screen
<br>Said cowsay you're mean!
<br>The sir died and Tux got some bucks
